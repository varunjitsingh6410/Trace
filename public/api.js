My name is Tiger and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on April 18, 2019.<p/><p/>I'm super sweet but very nervous in this environment. If you go slow and give me head and neck pets I will start to warm up to you. I don't really enjoy being held, I'm a little bit independent and it makes me uncomfortable. I haven't ever lived with a cat, but I think I would probably like them and would give it a try. <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>",

I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up.
